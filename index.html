    <p>
        A patient, hardworking fourth-year student eager and willing to learn quickly and take initiative on projects to assist in a position. I have had one summer research position working with the National Science Foundation’s Research Experience for Undergraduates through New Mexico State University’s BIG Data Analytics for Cyber-physical Systems. I observed how fear is displayed in video games through agent interactions. I created over 50 projects throughout my educational journey, ranging in industry fields such as game development, cryptography, data structures and algorithms, visual arts, and finance. 
		I consider myself a people-person. I enjoy connecting with others through listening and dialogue. I also appreciate the art of storytelling. Whether I am sharing my own or listening to others’, I value the mental and emotional experiences that occur when we share a part of ourselves. As Gonzaga’s Student Body Association as the Campus Inclusivity Coordinator, and I am over-zealous to apply my love of sharing with Gonzaga’s community. I am working on projects centered around disability awareness, BIPOC and LGBTQ+ appreciation, and connecting Gonzaga with the city and county of Spokane.
